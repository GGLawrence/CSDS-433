Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of databases in general, and relational databases in particular (database design,
E/R model, relational algebra(RA), tuple relational calculus (TRC), SQL (CSDS 341 or equivalent)
Basic knowledge on data structures (stacks, lists, queues, trees), algorithms (basic searching
and sorting, iteration, recursion, Big O analysis) (CSDS 233) and discrete structures (graphs, trees, sets) and basic logic (CSDS 302).
Objectives:

stores, Parallel Databases, Distributed Databases, Cloud‐Based Databases.
Paper presentations and critiquing.
Experience in project design (survey of a research area, identifying a research problem, developing it as much as possible), report writing (project proposal, progress report, and final project report), demonstration and presentation, as well as experience in working in groups.
